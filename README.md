# Car Price Prediction
## Description
I have trained a ML model to predict the resale value of cars based on attributes such as the fuel type, # of previous owners, transmission type, current market price for new car of same model and age of the car.<br>
## Implementation Details
The dataset was taken from Kaggle <br>[Link]: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho <br>
I used Google Collab to build my model with sklearn features. The best fitting model parameters were exported as a .pickle file to be used to predict prices while deployed.<<br>
I deployed the model using flask and jsonify libraries and a simple front-end interface (fig. below) using HTML to get input data to predict the car-price.<br>
